As with many malignancies, cytogenetic information has become increasingly
important to the diagnosis and proper treatment of colorectal cancer. In
particular, several recent studies have confirmed that KRAS is not only one of
the most commonly mutated genes in colorectal cancer, but also essential to
treatment decision-making. Several key studies have demonstrated that patients
with mutant KRAS do not respond to treatment with epidermal growth factor
inhibitors. This finding has several implications for clinicians who treat
patients with metastatic colorectal cancer. The following monograph includes
discussions on the key issues surrounding the integration of recent data on KRAS
status into the care of patients with this disease.
