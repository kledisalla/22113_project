Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) is relatively common, with an incidence estimated
as high as 50 cases per 100,000 people per year. This cancer mainly affects older
(>or=60 years) patients. MDS refers to a collection of hematologic malignancies
that share an ineffective production, or hematopoiesis, of normal bone marrow or
myeloid cells. As progressive bone marrow failure occurs, patients generally
display gradually worsening cytopenias specific to the type of bone marrow cell
affected, such as thrombocytopenia or neutropenia. MDS patients often develop
disease-related anemia requiring chronic blood transfusion; this can lead to
complications including iron overload. As MDS progresses and the number of bone
marrow blasts increases, the disease transforms into acute myelogenous leukemia.
